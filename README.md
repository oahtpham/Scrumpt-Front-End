This application was inspired by the Scrum Agile Methodology, allowing users to track different sprints and their associated stories within the project workflow. Each Sprint has 5 stages, where associated stories or features can be found under. This allows useres to visually see the progress of each planned feature build.

Users have full CRUD functionality with the ability to add sprints and stories. 

The tools, frameworks, and libraries used to create this include:

- Javascript
- React/Redux (front-end)
- React synthetic events (drag-and-drop feature)
- Ruby on Rails API (back-end)
- Semantic UI Design
